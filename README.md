<h2 align="left"> My exploration on Google Assistant üí°</h2>
<h5> I see Google Assistant as the future of technology. Technology was invented to help people do activities more effectively. Hence, with the existence of Google Assistant, which is capable of helping people in various ways, things are possibly done more effectively and not time-consuming. It solves many problems human can face every day, such as: </h5>

<ul>
  <li><b> Google Assistant can help people with disabilities to be able to do things they previously can't.</b> Speech impaired people used to have special application in their smartphone to help them to talk. On the other hand, blind people used to have special application called screen reader too, to help them see the world. With Google Assistant, they can save time to get things done. Google Assistant as a virtual assistant help speech impaired people to do things on their phone just like the others by using text commands. Blind people no more need to wrestle with hearing one by one word on their screen to decide which to be selected; Google Assistant will read and select it for them with just voice commands. In conclusion, Google Assistant can be a solution for people with disabilities. </li>
  <li><b> To normal people, Google Assistance enables them do things efficiently. </b> Many people in this world are busy, thus they have such demanding schedule. To make things easier and not time-consuming, Google Assistant help people read notifications, set reminders, send messages, find something over the internet, control devices, and many more. In this era, the Internet Of Things, combined with Google Assistant technology, can control smart home. We don't need to worry anymore whether has or hasn't we locked the doors or other stuffs. </li>
</ul>

<h5>In conclusion, Google Assistant as a technology innovation has fulfilled it's function, that is to help people get things done efficiently and effectively.</h5>

<h4> Maybe some of you wonders,</h4>
<h2> Why must Google Assistant? ‚ÅâÔ∏è</h2>
<h5> Google Assistant also has its strengths and weaknesses, then, <b>What are they?</b></h5>

<h5><i>Strength ‚ûï</i></h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Google Assistant is integrated to all Google Account Services, thus can be synchronized with any devices.</b> This is why many people, including me, choose Google Assistant rather than other voice assistants. It can save time by having my documents and reminders on both my laptop and smartphone. If I don't turn on my smartphone, I will still have the back up on my laptop, and vice versa. This is really helping for me, and probably many people out there, including you üòâ</li>
  <li><b>Google Assistant is not only integrated to Android, but also iPhone.</b> The flexibility of Google Assistant surely helps many people, don't you think so? </li>
  <li><b>Google Assistant can "spy" you in positive ways.</b>It can hear and gather informations about our activities when it is turned on, even though we think that it isn't hearing us. These informations are gathered to give us recommendations on what we would likely need or want.</li>
  <li><b>Google Assistant is currently the smartest voice assistant among all of its competitors.</b> In a recent study done by <a href="https://loupventures.com/annual-digital-assistant-iq-test/">Loop Ventures</a>, it was shown that Google Assistant is even more powerful than the others. The research was done by asking those voice assistants by questions in five aspects, namely local, commerce, navigation, information, and command. </li>
</ul>

<h5><i>Weakness ‚ûñ</i></h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Compared to another voice assistant, although Google Assistant is better in helping our jobs, it has lower social skills. </b> This is the point where it can be improved. While another voice assistant can witness a crime, Google Assistant hasn't able to do it yet. I believe that someday, Google Assistant will be able to do even more than that since it also has such powerful search engine. </li>
</ul>
