<h5> I see Google Assistant as the future of the technology. Technology was invented to help people do activities more effectively. Hence, with the existence of Google Assistant, which is capable of helping people in various ways, things are possibly done more effectively and not time consuming. It solves many problems human can face every day, such as: </h5>

<ul>
  <li><b> Google Assistant can help people with disabilities to be able to do things they previously can't.</b> Speech impaired people used to have special application in their smartphone to help them talking. In the other hand, blind people used to have special application called screen readers too, to help them see the world. With Google Assistant, they can save time to get things done. Google Assistant as a virtual assistant help speech impaired people to do things on their phone just like the others with text commands. Blind people no more need to wrestle with hearing one by one words in their screen to decide which to be selected; Google Assistant will read and select it for them with just voice commands. In conclusion, Google Assitant can be a solution for people with disabilities. </li>
  <li><b> To normal people, Google Assistance enables them do things efficiently. </b> Many people in this world are busy, thus they have demanding schedule. To make things easier and not time consuming, Google Assitance help people read notifications, set reminders, send messages, find something over the internet, controlling devices, and many more.

</ul>
<h5>In conclusion, Google Assistant as a technology innovation has fulfill it's function, to help people get things done efficient and effectively.</h5>

<h4> Maybe some of you wonders,</h4>
<h2> Why must Google Assistant? ‚ÅâÔ∏è</h2>
<h5> Google Assistant also has its strengths and weakness, then, <b>What are they?</b></h5>
<h5><i>Strength ‚ûï</i></h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Google Assistant is integrated to all Google Account Services, thus can be sync with any devices.</b> This is why many people, including me, choose Google Assistant rather than other voice assistants. It can save time by having my documents and reminders through my laptop and smartphone. Whether i don't turn on my smartphone, i will still have the back up on my laptop, and vice versa. This is really helping for me, and probably many people out there, including you üòâ</li>
  <li><b>Google Assistant is not only integrated to Android, but also iPhone.</b> The flexibility of Google Assistant surely helps many people, don't you agree? </li>
  <li><b>Google Assistant can "spy" you in positive ways</b>Google Assistant can hear and gather informations about our activities when it is turned on, even though we think it doesn't hear us. This informations are gathered to give us recommendations on what we would likely need.</li>
  <li><b>Google Assistant is currently the smartest voice assistant among all of the competitors.</b> In a recent study done by <a href="https://loupventures.com/annual-digital-assistant-iq-test/">Loop Ventures</a>, it was shown that Google Assistant is even more powerful than the others. The research was done by asking those voice assistants by questions in five aspects, namely local, commerce, navigation, information, and command. </li>
</ul>
<h5><i>Weakness ‚ûñ</i></h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Compared to other Voice Assistant, although Google Assistant is better in helping our jobs, it has lower social skill. </b> This is the point where it can be improved. While another voice assistant can witness a crime, Google hasn't able to do it yet. I believe that someday, Google Assistant will be able to do even more than that since it has powerful search engine. </li>
</ul>
